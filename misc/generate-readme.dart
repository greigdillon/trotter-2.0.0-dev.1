  ///
  /// Welcome to `trotter`, a library that simplifies working with meta-arrangements commonly
  /// encountered in combinatorics such as arrangements of combinations and permutations.
  ///
  /// `trotter` gives the developer access to pseudo-lists that 'contain'
  /// all selections (combinations, permutations, etc.) of objects taken from a specified list of
  /// items.
  ///
  /// The order of arrangements is based on the the order produced by the  [Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinhaus%E2%80%93Johnson%E2%80%93Trotter_algorithm)
  /// for ordering permutations, which I have generalized to combinations and arrangements
  /// that allow for replacement after item selection.
  ///
  /// The pseudo-list classes available are:
  /// * Combinations.
  /// * Permutations.
  /// * Compositions (combinations with replacement).
  /// * Amalgams (permutations with replacement).
  /// * Subsets (combinations of unspecified size).
  /// * Compounds (permutations of unspecified size).
  ///
  /// # Demos
  ///
  /// To see `trotter` in action:
  ///
  /// * Play [Falco Shapes](https://falco-shapes.netlify.com/),
  /// a little puzzle based on Marsha Falco's game of *Set*.
  ///
  /// * Explore the *huge* number of permutations of letters of the alphabet with [Permutation Products](https://permutation-products.netlify.com/).
  ///
  /// # Using `trotter`
  ///
  /// Include the following dependency in pubspec.yaml:
  ///
  /// ```text
  /// trotter: ^1.1.0
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Then, to import the library:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// import 'package:trotter/trotter.dart';
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## The basic classes
  ///
  /// ### Combinations
  ///
  /// A *combination* is a selection of items for which order is *not*
  /// important and items are *not* replaced after being selected.
  ///
  /// The `Combinations` class 'contains' all combinations of a set of items.
  ///
  functions.add(() {
    final bagOfItems = characters('abcde'),
        combos = Combinations(3, bagOfItems);
    for (final combo in combos()) {
      print(combo);
    }
  });

  ///
  /// ### Permutations
  ///
  /// A *permutation* is a selection of items for which order *is* important
  /// and items are *not* replaced after being selected.
  ///
  /// The `Permutations` class 'contains' all permutations of a set of items.
  ///
  functions.add(() {
    final bagOfItems = characters('abcde'), perms = Permutations(3, bagOfItems);
    for (final perm in perms()) {
      print(perm);
    }
  });

  ///
  /// (Notice that this library arranges permutations similarly to the way the
  /// [Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinhaus%E2%80%93Johnson%E2%80%93Trotter_algorithm)
  /// algorithm arranges permutations. In fact, if we get the permutations of
  /// *all* the specified items, e.g. `var perms = Permutations(bagOfItems.length, bagOfItems);`
  /// in the above code, the arrangement of permutations is exactly what would
  /// have resulted from applying the S-J-T algorithm. The algorithms in this library
  /// have an advantage in that they do not iterate through all k - 1 permutations in
  /// order to determint the kth permutation, however.)
  ///
  /// ### Compositions
  ///
  /// A *composition* (or combination with replacement) is a selection of items for
  /// which order is *not* important and items *are* replaced after being selected.
  ///
  /// The `Compositions` class 'contains' all compositions of a set of items.
  ///
  /// Here are all the compositions of three items taken from a bag of five items:
  ///
  functions.add(() {
    final bagOfItems = characters('abcde'), comps = Compositions(3, bagOfItems);
    for (final comp in comps()) {
      print(comp);
    }
  });

  ///
  /// ### Amalgams
  ///
  /// An *amalgam* (or permutation with replacement) is a selection of items for
  /// which order *is* important and items *are* replaced after being selected.
  ///
  /// The `Amalgams` class 'contains' all amalgams of a set of items.
  ///
  functions.add(() {
    final bagOfItems = characters('abcde'), amals = Amalgams(3, bagOfItems);
    for (final amal in amals()) {
      print(amal);
    }
  });

  ///
  /// ### Subsets
  ///
  /// A *subset* (or combination of unspecified length) is a selection of items for
  /// which order is *not* important, items are *not* replaced and the number of
  /// items is not specified.
  ///
  /// The `Subsets` class 'contains' all subsets of a set of items.
  ///
  functions.add(() {
    final bagOfItems = characters('abcde'), subs = Subsets(bagOfItems);
    for (final sub in subs()) {
      print(sub);
    }
  });

  ///
  /// ### Compounds
  ///
  /// A *compound* (or permutation of unspecified length) is a selection of items for
  /// which order *is* important, items are *not* replaced and the number of
  /// items is not specified.
  ///
  /// The `Compounds` class 'contains' all compounds of a set of items.
  ///
  functions.add(() {
    final bagOfItems = characters('abcde'), comps = Compounds(bagOfItems);
    for (final comp in comps()) {
      print(comp);
    }
  });

  ///
  /// ## Large indices
  ///
  /// Arrangement numbers often grow very quickly. For example, consider the number
  /// of 10-permutations of the letters of the alphabet:
  ///
  functions.add(() {
    final largeBagOfItems = characters('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'),
        perms = Permutations(10, largeBagOfItems);
    print(perms);
  });

  ///
  /// Wow! That's a lot of permutations! Don't iterate over them all!
  ///
  /// Notice that the word `algorithms` is a 10-permutation of the
  /// letters of the alphabet. What is the index of this permutation
  /// in our list of permutations?
  ///
  functions.add(() {
    final largeBagOfItems = characters('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'),
        perms = Permutations(10, largeBagOfItems),
        permutationOfInterest = characters('algorithms'),
        index = perms.indexOf(permutationOfInterest);
    print('The index of $permutationOfInterest is $index.');
    print('perms[$index]: ${perms[index]}');
  });

  ///
  /// Wow! That's almost seven trillion! Luckily we didn't need to
  /// perform that search using brute force! (Take that, Mathematica!)
  ///
  /// Since we sometimes can be working with indexes so large
  /// they cannot be represented using a 64 bit `int`, indexing and length
  /// arem implemented using `BigInt`.
  ///
  functions.add(() {
    final largeBagOfItems = characters('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'),
        comps = Compounds(largeBagOfItems);
    print('There are ${comps.length} compounds of these letters!');
    BigInt lastCompoundIndex = comps.length - BigInt.one;
    print('The last compound is ${comps[lastCompoundIndex]}.');
  });

  ///
  /// Unless you're immortal, don't use `comps().last` to
  /// access the last compound in the previous example!
  ///
  /// ## Syntactic sugar
  ///
  /// ### Lists
  ///
  /// `trotter` provides extensions that allow us to generate combinatoric
  /// arrangements directly from lists...
  functions.add(() {
    final subsets = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].subsets();
    for (final subset in subsets()) {
      print(subset);
    }
  });

  ///
  /// ### Strings
  ///
  /// ... and strings, in which case it assumes we mean arrangements of the
  /// characters in the string.
  functions.add(() {
    final subsets = 'abcde'.subsets();
    for (final subset in subsets()) {
      print(subset);
